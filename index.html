    <h2>About TED</h2>
    <p>
      TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. What began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment, and Design converged has evolved into a global platform showcasing ideas across countless disciplines.<br><br>
      Through the power of storytelling, TED Talks, TEDx events, TED-Ed lessons, and the TED Fellows program, TED empowers individuals worldwide to share ideas that can change perspectives, lives, and, ultimately, the world.<br><br>
      At TED, a single idea ‚Äî delivered passionately ‚Äî can start a movement, spark innovation, and inspire hope.
Because ideas have the power to reshape humanity.<br><br>
      TEDx events, independently organized under the TED brand, bring communities together to share local stories and global ideas. Each event is a unique tapestry of voices, experiences, and insights that reflect the spirit of its community.<br><br>
      TEDxAssam University Silchar 2025 is a celebration of the Northeast's resilience, creativity, and transformative power. It is a platform for untold stories that deserve to be heard on a global stage.
