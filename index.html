    <h2>About Assam University</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 1994, Assam University Silchar is a Central University that stands at the crossroads of knowledge,
      culture, and resilience. Nestled in the serene hills of Southern Assam, it reflects the spirit of the Northeast —
      deeply rooted, richly diverse, and constantly evolving.<br><br>
      The university encompasses 16 schools and 35+ departments, offering programs across disciplines such as
      humanities, sciences, technology, law, management, and environmental studies. Its verdant campus, spread across
      over 600 acres, is more than a learning space — it is a living ecosystem where ideas grow, disciplines merge, and
      traditions blend with innovation.<br><br>
      What truly distinguishes Assam University is its commitment to inclusivity and regional empowerment. The
      institution plays a vital role in preserving indigenous knowledge systems, promoting linguistic diversity, and
      addressing the socio-economic challenges of the Barak Valley and the wider Northeast.<br><br>
      Home to thousands of students from across India, AUS fosters a multicultural environment where debates are
      encouraged, creativity is celebrated, and the spirit of inquiry thrives. The university has contributed to policy,
      grassroots change, and research that directly impacts lives in remote and underserved areas.<br><br>
      At TEDxAssam University Silchar 2025, this university becomes more than a venue — it becomes the voice of the
      East. A place where stories of resilience, dreams born from adversity, and visions for a brighter future find the
      global stage they deserve.<br><br>

      <h2>VOICES FROM THE EAST : Resilience in the Face of Adversity</h2>
      <p>
        The theme for TEDxAssam University Silchar 2025, “Voices from the East: Resilience in the Face of Adversity,” is
        a powerful ode to the quiet strength that defines Northeast India. This is a land often romanticized for its
        beauty or reduced to stereotypes — but beneath its scenic calm lies a roaring depth of lived experiences,
        cultural pride, and unshakeable courage.<br><br>

        Resilience in the East is not loud. It doesn’t always wear medals or make headlines. It is found in the
        grandmother who still sings lullabies in a language the world forgot. In the young girl walking miles to school
        through monsoon-soaked terrain. In the artisan who molds tradition into innovation. In the farmer who plants
        hope despite the flood.<br><br>

        The East has endured — not with bitterness, but with creativity. Not by resisting change, but by reshaping it.
        Here, resilience is deeply human: personal, cultural, environmental, and collective. From surviving conflict and
        natural disasters to fighting for representation and identity, this region has carved out a space of strength,
        despite being left on the margins for too long.<br><br>

        This TEDx event is not just about storytelling — it’s about witnessing transformation. It’s about understanding
        how adversity becomes a forge for ideas, and how pain can give birth to purpose. We aim to shine a spotlight on
        the region’s innovators, educators, creators, healers, and rebels — those who continue to dream in the face of
        drought, displacement, or disillusionment.<br><br>

        “Voices from the East” is a call to listen — deeply, humbly, and wholeheartedly. To listen to the communities
        that hold wisdom beyond textbooks. To the unheard melodies of survival. To the soft defiance of identity
        preserved through generations.

        Because when the East speaks, it doesn’t ask for sympathy — it offers vision, grace, and a reminder that
        resilience isn’t just the ability to survive — it’s the courage to thrive.
